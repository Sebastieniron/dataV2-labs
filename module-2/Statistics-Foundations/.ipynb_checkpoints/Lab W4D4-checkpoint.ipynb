    "# Lab | Statistics Foundations\n",
    "In this lab we are going to put into practice what we learned about the foundations of statistics. You won't need to use Python, just your brain and a little bit of *Markdown*. \n",

    "Today you'll need to complete the challenges described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "You need to submit a markdown file with the solution to the following challenges. You can create a new *.md* file or directly edit the *README.md* to include your solutions.\n",
